            <h3>European Variety Shows</h3>
            <p>Amusement establishments, which began to show "small" forms of entertainment, appeared in Europe at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1720, the theater "Variety" was opened in Paris, where various musical skits and farces were shown. The name "variety show" became a household name, and this form of entertainment, with some changes, soon spread throughout Europe and the USA: in England, variety shows were shown in the music hall, in France  - in cafe-chantans, in the USA - in vaudeville and burlesque. Comedy was one of the types of entertainment at the variety show: in addition to comedians, singers performed there, dancers and other artists.</p>

            <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
            <p>In Great Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, a "small" form of comedy was shown in a variety show at the music hall. Comedian performances were subject to prior censorship by the office of the Lord Grand Chamberlain of England, however the Theaters Act 1968 abolished theater censorship entirely. In the post-war period, music halls fell into disrepair amid the development of television and radio. By the 1970s, music halls had virtually ceased to exist.</p>
            <p>A new venue for comedy was workers' clubs, where singers and other artists performed in addition to comedians. The most popular club comedians soon made their way onto TV with variety shows filmed in the clubs themselves. Since the 70s. in the UK, the American stand-up style begins to dominate: in 1979, the Comedy Store comedy club was opened in London, named after the American club, and an increasing number of comedians are falling under the influence of American stand-up comedians.

            <h3>United States</h3>
            <p>The origins of American stand-up come from people like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Bill Cosby, Woody Allen.</p>
            <p>The eighties were the decade of the first "boom" of stand-up comedy. The first national superstars emerged from stand-up - Eddie Murphy, Jerry Seinfeld, Roseanne Barr, Bill Cosby and others. Stand-up comedy was everywhere: each channel had its own stand-up show, new comedy clubs appeared, and a huge number of new comedians came to stand-up.</p>
            <p>In the nineties, the American stand-up bubble burst. With an overabundance of comedy clubs in the country, it became more and more difficult for each club to do business, as a large number of clubs needed even more comedians. In this regard, the quality of comedy began to inevitably fall, which led to a drop in the popularity of clubs and the exit of some establishments from business.</p>

            <h3>Russia</h3>
            <p>In Russia, stand-up comedy began to develop in the mid -2000s. Although a number of journalists believe that the first artist to use elements of the stand-up genre is Jan Arlazorov.  Interest in stand-up was formed against the backdrop of the spread of recordings and translations of performances by Western comedians. The first stand-up show on Russian TV came out at the end of 2012  - "Central Microphone" on the STS channel. In 2013, the show "Stand Up" was launched on TNT. In 2014, the Leningrad Stand-Up Club project was launched at STS .</p>
