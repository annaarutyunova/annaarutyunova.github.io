      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Stand-Up Comedy is relatively new to Russia, and not everyone knows about it yet. This website will help introduce people to Russian Stand Up Comedy and guide them through the most popular Stand-Up platforms and comedians in Russia. It will also help link new comedians to the necessary resources and help them find stages where they can perform and get more experience.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is intended for everyone who enjoys watching Stand-Up, wants to learn more about the movement in Russia, or wants to share their comedy. From my experience, I would say it is mostly people ages 15-35 years old. Among them the majority is college students: those who regularly use YouTube and social media for entertainment. Since Stand-Up is new in Russia, it is more appreciated and understood my younger generations, who seem to be more open-minded and free than their parents.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>What is Stand Up Comedy?</h4>
      <p>
        Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy the comedian usually recites a fast-paced succession of humorous stories, short jokes called "bits", and one-liners, which constitute what is typically called a monologue, routine or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music or magic tricks to enhance their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars, neo-burlesques, colleges, and theaters.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <h4>European variety shows </h4>
      <img src="images/old mic1.jpg" alt="retro mic">
      <p>Amusement establishments, which began to show "small" forms of entertainment, appeared in Europe at the beginning of the 18th century . In 1720, the theater " Variety " was opened in Paris , where various musical skits and farces were shown . The name "variety show" became a household name, and this form of entertainment, with some changes, soon spread throughout Europe and the USA : in England, variety shows were shown in the music hall , in France  - in cafe-chantans, in the USA - in vaudeville and burlesque. Comedy was one of the types of entertainment at the variety show: in addition to comedians , singers performed there ,dancers and other artists.
      </p>
      
      <h4>United Kingdom</h4>
      <img src="images/jimmy-carr.jpg" alt="image for page">
      <p>In Great Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries , a "small" form of comedy was shown in a variety show at the music hall . Comedian performances were subject to prior censorship by the office of the Lord Grand Chamberlain of England , however the Theaters Act 1968 abolished theater censorship entirely. In the post-war period, music halls fell into disrepair amid the development of television and radio. By the 1970s , music halls had virtually ceased to exist.
        A new venue for comedy was workers' clubs, where singers and other artists performed in addition to comedians. The most popular club comedians soon made their way onto TV with variety shows filmed in the clubs themselves. Since the 70s . in the UK, the American stand-up style begins to dominate: in 1979, the Comedy Store comedy club was opened in London , named after the American club, and an increasing number of comedians are falling under the influence of American stand-up comedians.
      </p>
      <h4>United States</h4>
      <img src="images/LouisCK-Sorry.jpg" alt="image for page">
      <p>The eighties were the decade of the first "boom" of stand-up comedy. The first national superstars emerged from stand-up - Eddie Murphy , Jerry Seinfeld , Roseanne Barr , Bill Cosby and others. Stand-up comedy was everywhere: each channel had its own stand-up show, new comedy clubs appeared, and a huge number of new comedians came to stand-up.
        In the nineties, the American stand-up bubble burst. With an overabundance of comedy clubs in the country, it became more and more difficult for each club to do business, as a large number of clubs needed even more comedians. In this regard, the quality of comedy began to inevitably fall, which led to a drop in the popularity of clubs and the exit of some establishments from business.
        </p>
      <h4>Russia </h4>
      <img src="images/ruslan scena flipped.jpg" alt="image for page">
      <p>In Russia, stand-up comedy began to develop in the mid -2000s . Although a number of journalists believe that the first artist to use elements of the stand-up genre is Jan Arlazorov . Interest in stand-up was formed against the backdrop of the spread of recordings and translations of performances by Western comedians. The first stand-up show on Russian TV came out at the end of 2012  - "Central Microphone" on the STS channel . In 2013, the show "Stand Up" was launched on TNT . In 2014, the Leningrad Stand-Up Club project was launched at STS .</p>
