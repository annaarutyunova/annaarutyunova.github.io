      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a Russian college student in America, and I love Russian Stand Up Comedy. It is relatively new to Russia, and not everyone knows about it yet. I find it to be a great way to make diverse Post-Soviet Russia open up to the outside world and to bring the nation together, helping people understand each other and better connect with each other’s cultures on a deeper level. I want to introduce as many people as possible to Russian Stand Up Comedy and guide them on their journey of treating life with humor, becoming more open and genuine to people around and getting to know wonderful comedians amongst them. It’s the pain of life that people share to make this world a better place. It’s the real life expressed in comedy. It’s the way to bond. Stand Up Comedy is good for the soul! Take part in the movement not only as audience, but as a comedian. There are lots of resources to engage in this force, and they are all compiled here, on this website. Everyone has something to share with the world. Why not you?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is intended for everyone who enjoys watching Stand-Up and wants to learn more about the movement in Russia. From my experience, I would say it is mostly people ages 15-35 years old. Among them I think the majority is college students: those who regularly use YouTube and social media for entertainment. I also have to note that Stand-Up is new in Russia, and is more appreciated and understood my younger generations, who seem to be more open-minded and free than their parents.</p>  <!-- change this -->
