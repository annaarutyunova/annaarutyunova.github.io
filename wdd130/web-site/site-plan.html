      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Stand-Up Comedy is relatively new to Russia, and not everyone knows about it yet. This website will help introduce people to Russian Stand Up Comedy and guide them through the most popular Stand-Up platforms and comedians in Russia. It will also help link new comedians to the necessary resources and help them find stages where they can perform and get more experience.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is intended for everyone who enjoys watching Stand-Up, wants to learn more about the movement in Russia, or wants to share their comedy. From my experience, I would say it is mostly people ages 15-35 years old. Among them the majority is college students: those who regularly use YouTube and social media for entertainment. Since Stand-Up is new in Russia, it is more appreciated and understood my younger generations, who seem to be more open-minded and free than their parents.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>What is Stand Up Comedy?</h4>
      <p>
        Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy the comedian usually recites a fast-paced succession of humorous stories, short jokes called "bits", and one-liners, which constitute what is typically called a monologue, routine or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music or magic tricks to enhance their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars, neo-burlesques, colleges, and theaters.
